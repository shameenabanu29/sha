Horse colic prediction

Introduction :
      

      This data science project leverages historical medical records to effectively determine the survival probability of horses with colic by utilizing predictive models that evaluate the likelihood of their survival, taking into account past medical conditions.



Objective:


        * estimate the probability of survival for horses affected by colic.
        * provide valuable insight to veterinarians and horse owners.
        *identify the most influential features for accurately predicting outcomes.


   


Approach:

        

  Data Collection: Dataset containing information about horses, including various features such as age, breed, temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, capillary refill time, abdominal distension, etc. This dataset should also include labels indicating whether each horse experienced colic or not.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables if necessary.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Identify relevant features that may contribute to predicting horse colic. You may need to perform feature selection techniques to choose the most important features or engineer new features from existing ones.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for classification. Some common models for binary classification tasks like predicting horse colic include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional): Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance further using techniques like grid search or random search.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment, where it can make predictions on new data.
          

        Data transformation:
                the "outcomes" colums was converted from           catagorical   to numeric.




Methods: 
          iam using here random forest clssifier and decision tree
          because acuracy is good when compared to other methods in supervised machine learning.

Summary:
         most effective model:
         randomforest classifier ,test accuracy  is good.
